# basic-algo-multisig
A basic proof-of-concept Algorand multisig


This code is for learning and testing purposes only and in no way should be used in production systems. It is based on the assumption to connect on the Algorand testnet network. So DO NOT USE any of your mainnet private keys or keys which are somehow connected to real funds, but instead generate new disposable keys/seeds to be used here only.
